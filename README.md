# ButtelTunk

A tank game with AI on a large open landscape. The goal is simple, destroy eachother.

This game is being built as part of a course and therefore as a learning excercise more than anything else.

Built with Unreal Engine 4.14
The project is set up to be used with Visual Studio as well.
You will likely need to manually import the starter content pack from unreal for this to work in engine as expected. 

Any questions, feel free to open an issue.
